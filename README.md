# MLP-Classifier-from-Scratch-in-JAX
Implement two hidden layer neural network classifier from scratch in JAX.

# What is this JAX thing ?
JAX is an automatic differentiation (AD) toolbox developed by a group of people at Google Brain and the open source community. It aims to bring differentiable programming in NumPy-style onto TPUs. JAX (Just After eXecution) is a recent machine/deep learning library developed by DeepMind. Unlike Tensorflow, JAX is not an official Google product and is used for research purposes. The use of JAX is growing among the research community due to some really cool features.
